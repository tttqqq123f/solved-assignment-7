Add buttons to the form to execute the two methods (left, right) defined for each instantiation. When a button is pressed, update the respective object instantiation and redisplay the web form.<strong>Hint</strong>: Create a method in the object to return all the properties in an associative array and then save and read the array from the session to instantiate and apply methods.The layout, color choices, use of HTML/CSS and aethetics of the web page(s) created will be used in calculating your grade.</td>
